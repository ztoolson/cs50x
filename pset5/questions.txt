0.  How many different colors does each format support?
A.  BMP - 16 million (2^24)
    JPG - 16 million
    PNG - 15 million  
    GIF - 256

1.  Which of these formats supports animation?
A.  GIF

2.  What's the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
A.  Lossy compression uses approximations when reconstructing data from
    its compressed form for representing the original data  vs. a 
    lossless compression which allows the original data to be perfectly 
    reconstrcuted from the compressed data

3.  Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?
A.  JPG

4.  What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?
A.  The file is removed from the FAT tracking systems and the file's contents remain 
    on the drive and are marked as free space. 

5.  What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete
    cannot be recovered?
A.  1. Destroy the hard drive physically or with a magnet
    2. Overwrite all data on the disk with null values (dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda on linux)

WHODUNNIT?
6.  What is stdint.h?
A.  stdint.h is a header file that declares sets of integer types having specific widths (number of bits to store the number)

7.  What is the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t and uint16_t in a program
A.  To specify the width of the variable. This is particularly useful for images to ensure proper structure of the file.

8.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD? (Assume 32 bit architecture)
A.  BYTE  - 1 byte (8bits)
    DWORD - 4 bytes (32bits)
    LONG  - 4 bytes (32bits)
    WORD  - 2 bytes (16bits)

9.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hex) must the first 2 bytes of any BMP file be?
A.  ASCII   - B    M 
    Decimal - 66   77
    Hex     - 0x42 0x4d

10. What is the difference between bfSize and biSize?
A.  bfSize - Describe the entire file's sie in bytes
    biSize - Size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER in bytes (usually 40)

11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
A.  The image is top-down format instead of the default bottom-up for the image data.

12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP's color depth (i.e. bits per pixel)
A.  biBitCount 

13. Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37?
A.  If the user does not write permission in the directory the file will be written to.

14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
A.  We only want to manipulate one struct per read.

15. What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
A.  3

16. What does fseek do?
A.  Sets the file position of the stream to a given offset. 

17. What is SEEK_CUR?
A.  The current position of the file pointer.

18. TODO
